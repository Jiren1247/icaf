            We are the national arts organization for American children and the global arts organization 
            for the world’s children. 
            <br>
            Since 1997, we have enabled and empowered them to reclaim and reshape the future. 
            <br>
            We inspire children and kindle the “inner child” in professionals for collaborative innovation,
            conflict resolution, and futures thinking.

            <a href="/mission/arts-olympiad.html">The Arts Olympiad</a>—our school art program—fosters students’ creativity so they can marshall the Artificial Intelligence Revolution 
            by reimaging themselves as “Artist-Atheltes” with creative minds and healthy bodies, free to imagine and play.

            and unity at The National Mall across the U.S. Capitol—provides a transformative experience that develops mutual empathy

            <br>
            <br>
